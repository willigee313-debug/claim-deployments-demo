# Claim Deployments Demo

This application demonstrates how to transfer a Vercel project from one account to another using the [Claim Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/claim-deployments) feature.

The demo covers the entire process, including creating a project in the host team, initiating the transfer, and enabling users to claim the project for themselves.

Try it out at: [https://claim-deployments-demo.vercel.app](https://claim-deployments-demo.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

To set up the project, add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
TEAM_ID=""
ACCESS_TOKEN=""
```

- `TEAM_ID`: The ID of the team where projects will be tranferred from. You can find this in the Vercel Dashboard under **Team Settings**.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`: An access token used to interact with Vercel's REST API. You can generate one from the [Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/settings/tokens) page in the Vercel Dashboard. Ensure that the token's scope matches the team where the projects will be transferred from.

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the demo application.
